Projects for Tec de Monterrey's B.S. in Computer Science and Technology Course: 
Programming of Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms. These course requires
2 project submissions, the first one, to evaluate the implementation of data 
structures and the second one for algorithm analysis.

### Data Strucutres
The data structures evidence is an implementation of a Doubly Linked Circular List
and a Priority Queue.

#### Running the code
The implementation of data structures was done with additional c files, to execute the main program it is necesarry to compile them all. For the sake of demonstration we show the commands that will compile all files for each of the data strucutres required using the GNU C compiler (gcc), assuming you are on the corresponding directory:

**Doubly Linked Circular List**
```
$ gcc main.c CircularDoublyLinkedList.c -o main
```

**Doubly Linked Circular List**
```
$ gcc main.c queue.c priorityQueue.c -o main
```
To run the program just execute the file generated by this commands (`main`) inside your terminal.

### Algorithms
The algorithm analysis evidence consists on 2 solutions for the 8 queens problem,
one is with brute force and the second one has to optimize the time complexity
using algorithm design techniques like Divide and Conquer or Dynamic Programming.
