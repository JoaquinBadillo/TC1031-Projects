Projects for Tec de Monterrey's B.S. in Computer Science and Technology Course: 
Programming of Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms. These course requires
2 project submissions, the first one, to evaluate the implementation of data 
structures and the second one for algorithm analysis.

### Data Strucutres
The data structures evidence is an implementation of a Doubly Linked Circular List
and a Priority Queue.

### Algorithms
The algorithm analysis evidence consists on 2 solutions for the 8 queens problem,
one is with brute force and the second one has to optimize the time complexity
using algorithm design techniques like Divide and Conquer or Dynamic Programming.
